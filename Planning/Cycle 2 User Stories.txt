Max: Some of the issues that I have run into:
    1) ConcurrectModificationException:
                                Level and GameComponent are trying to access
                                the creatures ArrayList. Need to modify the 
                                structure of the code to avoid this exception.
    2) First text line error:
                                Objects that correspond to the characters of
                                the first line of the text file are not 
                                displaying properly. 
    3) NullPointerException:
                                Trying to add a CentipedeComponent to the
                                occupationMap results in a NullPointer error.
2) and 3) are fixed now, however, 1) persists.
